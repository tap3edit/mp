# mp
mp is a library that offers a set of functions for the administration of memory pools in C language. The concept of memory pool promises an easier and a less fragmented handling of memory. The memory is allocated at the beginning of the program, or whenever needed in big chunks and freed just once at the end of the program, instead of multiple times for each allocation. The library offers analogue functions to malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), memalign(), strdup() and asprintf(), each of them taking a chunk of the current memory pool (or a specific one) instead of the memory directly from the heap. Among other functionalities the library offers the possibility of printing out the memory pools status and memory dump to a file. (Unfortunately no support yet to Microsoft Visual Studio).  For including these functionalities to your project just add the header file mp.h and the libmp.a static library. An example on how to use the functions can be found in the test.c file
